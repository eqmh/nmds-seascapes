# nmds-seascapes

This repo contains data tables generated by the Matlab routine 'imarpe_survey.m' containing taxa densities collected during IMARPE fisheries surveys (Peru) and seascape class identified at each sampled site:

-taxa_table_month.csv (for monthly seascape class; 4km pixel)

-taxa_table_8d.csv (for weekly seascape class; 4km pixel)

These tables are built using survey data from the original spreadsheet 'Bitacora acustica 120 kHz.xlsx'

The nmds_seascapes.Rmd reads these data tables and creates NMDS plots to evaluate seascape affinity by taxonomic groups.
